                        <p>
                            Simply put, leatherworking is the process of making goods using leather. It is one of the oldest crafting professions, dating back over 7000 years. Though leather can be made from many different animal hides (a process called Tanning), most leather that people commonly think today of is made from the hide of cows. Once cured, the animal hides can be crafted into an almost endless variety of products such as belts, wallets, clothing, shoes, pet accessories, and furniture. This video, courtesy of Little King Goods, demonstrates the making of a leather belt.

                        <p>
                            BLL was founded by Andrew Fox as a hobby business in 2019. Initially focused on craft fairs and other small community events, the volume of orders he was receiving led to Andrew taking on an assistant, his friend Levi Aichele, to help with the workload. As the business continued to expand, Levi was later made into a full partner. Once the COVID-19 pandemic halted the local events that BLL had made most of their sales from, the team transitioned to online retail. After unexpected success and continued growth, the business was officially incorporated in early 2020 headquartered in Sanger, CA. What started as a small hobby has evolved into highly profitable business that has sold products to customers throughout the United States as well as multiple countries all around the globe.
